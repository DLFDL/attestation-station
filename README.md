Attestation Station dApp

Introduction

Attestation Station is a decentralized application built on the Ethereum blockchain, enabling users to create, verify, and revoke attestations for digital documents securely. By leveraging blockchain technology, it ensures the authenticity and integrity of attested documents.
Features

    Document Attestation: Users can attest to the authenticity of a document by generating and recording a unique hash of the document on the Ethereum blockchain.
    Verification: Allows anyone with the document to verify its authenticity by comparing the document's hash stored on the blockchain.
    Revocation: Document attestations can be revoked by the original attester, adding flexibility and control over the attested documents.
